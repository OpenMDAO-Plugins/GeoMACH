GeoMACH (Geometry-centric MDAO of Aircraft Configurations with High fidelity) is an aircraft design tool suite featuring parametric modelers for the geometry and structure of the aircraft that are efficient and supply derivatives with respect to all parameters, enabling optimization with large numbers of design variables.

NOTE: GeoMACH is currently in a pre-alpha state and is under heavy development.  APIs may change.
